    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantopian was a crowd-sourced hedge fund that operated a research and backtesting platform where users could develop trading algorithms, a selection of which were licensed by Quantopian for inclusion in its hedge fund. To support its business objective, Quantopian developed several open-source Python libraries, including Zipline, one of QuantRocket's two backtesters. Quantopian also developed a comprehensive lecture series on quantitative finance, which it released under a Creative Commons license. The lectures were originally developed to use Python 2 and Quantopian data, but have here been updated to use Python 3 and QuantRocket data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the closure of its crowd-sourced hedged fund, Quantopian shut down in 2020."

    "## Lecture Series Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The lectures are divided into four sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Intro to Python**: These lectures provide an introduction to Jupyter notebooks, Python, and several key data processing libraries in Python.\n",
    "2. **Topics in Statistics**: Covering a variety of topics that are broadly applicable in the field of statistics, these lectures are not specific to finance but typically include example applications to finance. \n",
    "3. **Topics in Finance**: Building on the broad foundation of the statistics lectures, these lectures dive into topics more specific to finance and portfolio management.\n",
    "4. **Futures Trading**: Some of the special considerations involved in futures trading are covered in these final lectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For computational analysis, the lectures rely most heavily on Python's numerous scientific computing libraries. Some of the lectures on financial topics also rely on the Pipeline API which was created by Quantopian and is available in QuantRocket. For data, the lectures utilize randomly generated data as well as actual financial data from QuantRocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus of Quantopian's crowd-sourced hedge fund was to develop market-neutral, long-short equity strategies for institutional investors. Consequently, the lectures are tilted toward this particular style of investment.  "

    "## Data Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Most lectures can be completed using free sample data from QuantRocket. Some lectures are designed to use larger datasets that require a QuantRocket subscription. These lectures can still be completed without a QuantRocket subscription by simply reading along (without querying data) or by substituting free sample data.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The data requirements for each lecture are noted in the table below."
